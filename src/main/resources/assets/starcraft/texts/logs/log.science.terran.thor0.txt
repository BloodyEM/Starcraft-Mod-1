#name: Thor: Overview
The Thor project has been shrouded in mystery since its inception. Agents of the Umojan Protectorate were the first to investigate the Dominion’s new terror weapon. Images from this investigation showed a huge bipedal war machine armed with a dorsal artillery battery that wouldn’t be out of place on a battleship. Most disturbing of all was the discovery that this monster could be built rapidly from the ground up by a standard Factory.
