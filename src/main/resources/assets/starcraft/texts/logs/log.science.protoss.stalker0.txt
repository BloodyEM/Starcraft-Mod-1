Unlike other Protoss, the Dark Templar refused to surrender their individuality to the collective psionic bond of the Khala. They were exiled from Aiur and eventually resettled on the distant planet of Shakuras. By focusing on their inner psionic strength and drawing power from the Void, the Dark Templar have become highly skilled in masking their presence. Combining this technique with the Protoss Dragoon walker model, the Dark Templar created Stalkers: machines controlled by the shadow essences of Dark Templar warriors. Stalkers are armed with Particle Disruptors and, with proper augmentation, can instantly teleport between locations. As a result, Stalkers can strike unexpectedly, catch fleeing enemies, or escape from unfavorable encounters.
