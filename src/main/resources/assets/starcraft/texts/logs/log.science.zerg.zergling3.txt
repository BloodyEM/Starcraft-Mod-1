The Zergling’s eyeball has a considerable optical aperture which allows the creature to see in the dark. This ability is further enhanced by a layer of tissue that reflects light, and the production of a dense substance which—depending on saturation levels—make its eyes glow orange or red, a clear indicator that the creature’s vision has fully adjusted to the darkness.
