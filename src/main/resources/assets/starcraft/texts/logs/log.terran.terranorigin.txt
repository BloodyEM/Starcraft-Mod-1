The terrans that colonized the Koprulu sector originally traveled from Earth in four deep-space supercarriers. Three of those gargantuan ships delivered the colonists to their new homes relatively intact, but the fourth ship was not so lucky. The Sarengo crashed into the planet Umoja, killing all 8,000 of its passengers, and carving an immense canyon into the planet's surface. The canyon is now home to drifters, squatters, and other odd characters that hide amongst the broken rocks and scattered wreckage. The Umojan Protectorate has long proclaimed the entire area to be a restricted area, and this often leads to fierce conflicts when Protectorate security forces decide to sweep the area of intruders.
