#name: Ultralisk: Overview
Bearing little resemblance to the docile Brontoliths from which they were evolved, Ultralisks are the most powerful of the Zerg ground forces. They serve as the backbone of the Swarm’s armies and are as dangerous as any armored vehicle. These massive monstrosities are used as living battering rams against their enemies. Their large bone-like scythes allow them to tear through most known substances with ease. The Ultralisk’s genetic material has been subjected to countless tests and experiments, and only the final viable code is used by Zerg Larvae to morph into new Ultralisks.
