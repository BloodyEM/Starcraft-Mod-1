#name: Zealot: Power Suit
Ornate armored suits protect the Zealot legions from enemy onslaught. As is tradition, every warrior must undergo rigorous training and trials before he is allowed to don the battlegear of his station. Each suit is an individual work of art reverently crafted by the Khalai, who outfit it with a personal plasma shield generator, a vital signs monitor, and navigation tools. To finish their work, they set psionically calibrated crystal matrices on the armor’s gleaming surface.
