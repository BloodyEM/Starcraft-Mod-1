All of the containment and reinforced structural integrity theorems I've developed from studying this crystal are starting to... well... crystallize. I think we might be able to contain energies that once required huge machines. Or even manufacture structures capable of hot landings from orbital origins with acceptable stresses.

I'm a sham. I haven't truly learned anything from this crystal. I've just observed the smallest details from it and somehow wrangled a few tidbits when the crystal... helped me. I don't understand how the protoss can possess technology of this magnitude and not rule the known universe. Perhaps they simply don't want to?

Last entry on this sample. I figured out where it is putting all that excess energy. It's feeding the Hyperion. Subtly helping to power the ship, balancing out some of the more ragged systems. It's giving of itself, and has been since it got here. Swann is excited that the ship is running so well, but he has no idea why. And I'm not going to tell him.
