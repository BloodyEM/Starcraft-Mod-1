Originally designed as a diplomatic enclave, Polaris Prime was envisioned as a place where disparate factions would gather and work out their differences in a peaceful manner. The station, consisting of two central meeting areas and six separated rooms, were well suited for the needs of visiting Ambassadors and their staff.

Polaris Prime was quickly abandoned when it fell into the ravenous path of the Swarm. Now, diplomacy of a different kind has begun, as those species that once spoke of peace return to present their arguments in a more aggressive manner.
