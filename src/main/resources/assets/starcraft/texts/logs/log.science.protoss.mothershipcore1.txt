#name: Mothership Core: Repulsor Cannon
After drawing power from the Khaydarin Crystal Core, the Repulsor Cannon projects a concentrated blast of semi-solid psionic energy—too dense for aerial combat—that causes damage by delivering kinetic and thermal energy. Each shot pierces matter violently, leaving a misty cloud of psionic fire in its wake.
