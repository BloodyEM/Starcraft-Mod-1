#name: The Twilight Zone
All across Shakuras lie strange places of power, many of which have not been fully probed by the nomadic Dark Templar who have made the twilight world their adopted home. One of these places is a foreboding and mysterious temple resting in the cracked earth of the remote Isle of Razjan. The four small shrines that lie in the temple connect to each other with almost perfectly symmetrical spiral paths sunken into the ground, forming what could only be a symbol of some cosmic significance. This peculiar complex may once have been a quiet, peaceful place for contemplation of the universe and the infinite beyond, but now the temple sees no such peace. The island temple lies well outside any established Protoss settlement or defensive outpost and this encourages raids on the complex by offworlders lusting for wealth, knowledge, and power.
