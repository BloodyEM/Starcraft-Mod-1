#name: The Ghost Town
Chau Sara has been a flash point for unparalleled hostilities during the Wars. Seeding the atmosphere with toxic spores, the Zerg enslaved the Terran population that founded the colony and changed the surface of the world to better support their Hive clusters. Then, out of the cold endlessness of space, a great Protoss fleet arrived and, seeking to prevent further infestation, incinerated the planet. Since that time, Chau Sara has been a lifeless world hanging in the void.
