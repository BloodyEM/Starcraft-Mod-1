#name: Ghost: Skinsuit
The Ghosts’ form-fitting Hostile Environment Suit is made up of psionically reactive nano-fibers. These fibers augment the wearer’s strength and endurance, dispensing the need for bulky powered armor. The suit offers nuclear, biological, and chemical protection by absorbing dangerous elements and rendering them inert. It also helps Ghosts channel their psionic energy. The outermost layer contains synthetic cells which, under psionic stimuli, refract light to synergize with a personal cloaking device and make the wearer invisible to the naked eye.
