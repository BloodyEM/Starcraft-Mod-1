Broken Mesa was the site of a Dominion bio-weapons testing facility on the desert world of Korhal. Shortly before the UED assault on Korhal, Terran scientists created a new and potentially devastating plasma-pulse weapon. As reports of an approaching enemy fleet reached the high command on Korhal, testing was ordered in hopes that the power of this weapon might destroy the UED armada. While in the final testing phase, Senior Scientist Ozmel Dodds turned traitor as he attempted to curry favor with the attacking UED forces. On the day of the final test, Dodds changed the pulse-modulation frequency on the weapon causing the awesome cannon to overload, destroying itself and the research facility that housed it. What happened to the scientist remains a mystery to this day, but the Broken Mesa site still sees occasional conflict as various factions attempt to discover the remains of the weapons lab and the fabled plasma-pulse weapon.
