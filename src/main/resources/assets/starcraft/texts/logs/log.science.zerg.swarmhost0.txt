#name: Swarm Host: Overview
The Swarm Host has no weapons of its own, but can represent an army unto itself.  Generated by the Infestation Pit, it spawns parasitic symbiotes known as Locusts, which attack any nearby enemies with volleys of acidic saliva.  This crawling monstrosity burrows into the ground in order to provide a seemingly endless supply of ferocious biological minions, and is often used in defensive maneuvers.  This lack of mobility can leave the Swarm Host vulnerable to quicker enemies with area damage like the Hellion.
