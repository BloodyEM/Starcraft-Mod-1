"Who designed this [censored] place? What [censored] "engineer" crawled out from his [censored] hole to inflict this [censored] [censored] upon my people? A [censored] platform split into two [censored] halves?

[CENSORED]!

Why are there no [censored] bridges on this [censored] platform? Are we just supposed to [censored] leap off one [censored] half to the other? And to top it all off, those [censored] don't even provide enough Vespene [censored] gas for operations! [censored] this place! It's just one big [censored] [censored] [censored] [censored]!"
