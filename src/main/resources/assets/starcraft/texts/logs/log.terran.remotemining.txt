#name: Kel-Morian Combine Remote World Mining
The Kel-Morian combine has been exploiting the ore deposits of remote worlds for decades. From time to time, their mining teams unearth strange artifacts or other physical evidence ancient civilizations. This was the case when they discovered a monstrous labyrinth at the Warrant VI dig site. Carbon dating shows that this gigantic series of underground caves dates back several millennia. Several Terran scholars have noted strong similarities between this maze and the patterns found in the Labyrinth of Crete, indicating that there may have been alien visitors on Earth long ago. This is, of course, secondary to the discovery of extensive mineral fields within the labyrinth to the Kel-Morian combine, and it seems unlikely that they would be interested in simply turning their find over to "the scientific community" without a fight.
