Now and again a giant platform is seen drifting through space, accompanied by a strange set of lights following in an eerie glow. Rumored to be the remains of an experimental arboretum platform jettisoned during the destruction of Korhal, the platform is said to contain a secret lab dedicated to the creation of strange and exotics plants. Plants, whose purpose remains unknown to this day.
