#name: Battlecruiser: Overview
These massive, heavily armored combat ships are virtual flying fortresses, built to keep the peace and dominate the space lanes of the Koprulu sector. Bristling laser batteries and thick neosteel armor make these imposing vessels some of the most powerful in Terran space. As such, many commanders use Battlecruisers as their headquarters during extended campaigns. Research has led to the development of alternative weapon and defense upgrades, including the dreaded Yamato Cannon.
