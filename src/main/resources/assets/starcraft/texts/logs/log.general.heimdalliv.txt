#name: Heimdall IV
The expansive shoreline of Heimdall IV is a peaceful setting where the bitter memories of battle can be washed away by waves, gently breaking over hundreds of miles of pristine beaches. The natural beauty of this planet has helped make it one of the more fashionable spots in the sector as the smell of the salt air and the bracing spray of the sea can restore the spirits of even the most shell-shocked veteran. The popularity of the sleepy resort setting has caused some unexpected occurrences, however, as members of opposing military forces sometimes decide to vacation there at the same time. It is only a matter of time before someone inevitably kicks sand in someone else's face and then the beaches become an impromptu battleground. Regardless of the outcome, the tropical rains always seem to wash away any signs of strife in time to prepare the beaches for the next gathering of those seeking rest and relaxation.
