In order to turn the power of the Prismatic Core into a controllable weapon, the Protoss employ a firing system with multiple lenses to stabilize its energy output, and a phase crystal to shape it into a cohesive beam. To further enhance the vessel’s combat capability, the Nerazim added three flux field projectors to amplify the power of the Prismatic Core. These projectors channel streams of unstable energy into the phase crystal, increasing the effectiveness of the Prismatic Beam against heavily armored targets.
