Long known for their clandestine operations, the Confederate's enigmatic Nova Squadron was created not only to gather intelligence on the various "Pirate Militias" that threatened Confederate security, but also to keep tabs on the various operative branches within the Confederate Armed Forces. Once the Confederacy was dissolved, Nova Squadron was forced to go into hiding. Whoever can maintain control of their former headquarters not only commands the most strategically advantageous site in the whole sector, but also has access to whatever priceless intelligence Nova Squadron may have left behind.
