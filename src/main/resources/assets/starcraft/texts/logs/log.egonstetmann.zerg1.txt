Zerg sample recovered by Raynor's Raiders, 6.10.2504.

Sample appeared dead when brought in, including tissue necrosis. However, tests now reveal frantic cellular activity, and it is moving.

This defies everything I understand about biology. I'm tracking massive generational changes in each cell. In the last hour, this thing has evolved more than humans did in 100,000 years.

If I can harness this, it could lead to huge military innovations for the Raiders.
