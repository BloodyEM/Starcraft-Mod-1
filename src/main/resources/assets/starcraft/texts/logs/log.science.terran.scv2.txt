#name: SCV: Neosteel Plating
Older T-280 Space Construction Vehicles had reinforced plating until the manufacturer decided to cut back on “unnecessary expenses”. This decision proved very unpopular among SCV pilots, and even spurred riots—which were quelled fatally by security forces—on one or two remote planets. Yet, the body count from the protests was dwarfed by the 58.8% increase in casualty rates due to flimsy vehicle plating. The risk associated with SCV operation has had little impact on the Dominion’s ability to recruit pilots who—more fearful of the front lines—are willing to work overtime on distant planets for low wages.
