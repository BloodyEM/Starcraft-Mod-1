#name: Ghost: C-10 Canister Rifle
The C-10 rifle fires 25mm antipersonnel rounds and specialized ammunition: EMP rounds that punch through shields and deplete energy sources, as well as Lockdown rounds—a relic from the days of the Confederacy—to disable mechanical targets. The C-10 comes with a low-frequency laser to paint targets for nuclear strikes, a magnetic grid tracker, and a general purpose flashlight. This weapon is a flawless amalgamation of neosteel and polymer.
