The plates that comprise the Void Ray’s armored hull are fashioned from a flexible alloy, and are designed to handle the stress caused by the sheer power of the Prismatic Core. The molecular stability of this alloy is very high, a quality that prevents the energies of the Prismatic Core from disrupting its atomic bonds and degrading its structure from within.
