To the numerous artists who call it home, the colony of Tashai is a place of great inspiration. Nestled on a small island in a sheltered oceanic cove, the colony has idyllic weather throughout the year, and the scenic views of the sea never cease to amaze visitors. Ewan Welke, the greatest living bard of our time, has spent many years at the retreat composing poetry in an ancient form known as haiku. In fact, it was his now well-known verse that gave the colony its name, Zephyr Cove.

peaceful island cove
blessed by the ocean's cool breath
the zephyr moves me
