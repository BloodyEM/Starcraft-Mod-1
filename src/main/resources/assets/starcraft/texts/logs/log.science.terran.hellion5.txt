#name: Hellion: Cabin
Hellion drivers enjoy the comfort of a pressurized cabin, worn faux-leather seats—lined with fireproof material capable of stopping shrapnel—and a lot of straps and padding to keep them in place while they whiz through all sorts of rough terrain. Some drivers opt to personalize their space, hanging dice, adding bobbleheads to the dash, or simple photographs, to remind them of home sweet home.
