#name: Ravager: Overview
The Ravager is the result of years of twisting and fine-tuning the genome of the Roach far beyond its biological limitations. This monstrosity wields plasma fire both in close-quarters combat and as a wedge to crack open entrenched positions, something the Swarm has struggled with in the past. Its heavier frame isn’t subtle, but, with the ability to launch gobs of Corrosive Bile at distant targets, the Ravager is an intelligent evolutionary adaptation to the challenges the Zerg face on the battlefield.
