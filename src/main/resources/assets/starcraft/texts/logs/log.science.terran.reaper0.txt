#name: Reaper: Overview
Marine candidates who remain unmanageable after neural resocialization are sent to be trained as Reapers. These troops are chemically altered to heighten their aggression even further, and then they are instructed in close-quarters combat and the use of Jet Packs. These grant Reapers a high degree of mobility, allowing them to traverse obstacles easily and cover ground rapidly. In combat, Reapers attack with rapid-fire dual Gauss Pistols. Reapers are guaranteed their freedom after two years of service, but none has survived for more than six months.
