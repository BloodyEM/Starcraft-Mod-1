#name: The Scorching Of Korhal
When the surface of Korhal was scorched by the nuclear fire unleashed by a salvo of one thousand Apocalype-class missiles, the planet was not the only thing to be permanently scarred. The few survivors of the holocaust saw their families and homes turn to ash in a single, brief, blinding moment. The memory of that horror has hardened the remaining men and women of Korhal into some of the fiercest warriors in the Terran sector. With a complete willingness to use their own nuclear arsenal against any potential enemy, their nuclear firestorms have incinerated many unwary foes.
