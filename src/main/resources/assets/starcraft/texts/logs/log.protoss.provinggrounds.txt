#name: The Proving Grounds
The ancient, vicious blood feuds that were born in the Aeon of Strife virtually flooded the proving grounds on Gyras with the life force of thousands of Protoss Warriors. This bloodshed ended when the mystic Khas called upon the forces of the Khaydarin Crystals and destroyed the arena. The ruins that now stand there serve as a grim reminder of both what has passed, and the purpose that the arena now serves. Although Khas strove to bring unification and enlightenment to his people, he also knew that some disputes would still demand resolution through force. Therefore, that place was sanctified as an arena of honor, and those who seek to settle personal matters come back to Gyras to prove their mettle in battle.
