#name: Phoenix: Ion Cannons
The main weapons of the Phoenix fire energy beams that consist of negatively charged ions. These cannons are designed to allow the Phoenix to fire while on the move, but their short wavelength limits the travel distance of each shot, as well as the damage caused to heavily armored targets. The Ion Cannons’ effective combat range presented a problem until the Protoss began to replace the old focusing lenses with the more advanced Anion Pulse-Crystals.
