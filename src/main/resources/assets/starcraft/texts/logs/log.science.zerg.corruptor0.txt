#name: Corruptor: Overview
Protoss and Terran forces alike deeply fear Corruptors. Fortunately these giant brain-like creatures, with their snapping beaks and dangling tentacles, are usually found near only the most advanced Hive clusters. The Corruptor is a genetic marvel that can cover targets in acid, causing them to take additional damage from attacks.
