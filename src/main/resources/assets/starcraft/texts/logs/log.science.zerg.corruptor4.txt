#name: Corruptor: Statocyst
This pear-shaped gland contains a solid, mineralized mass that floats in a low-density liquid. Its walls are coated in an impermeable substance of variable viscosity, and lined with small filaments. When the mineral core inside the gland shifts due to movement or orientation changes, the liquid and the filaments provide instant feedback to the Corruptor, allowing it to maintain its balance and navigate both in atmospheric conditions and deep space.
