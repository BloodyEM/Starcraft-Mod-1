The Tempest’s kinetic matrix produces extremely volatile energies. These energies are routed through the multiple resonators, coils, and amplifiers housed in the claw-like fore of the ship, where they are fused into a sphere of highly charged particles. The resulting projectile, while unstable, may be launched over great distances to soften up enemy forces or deal with defensive emplacements before Protoss armies engage in glorious battle.
