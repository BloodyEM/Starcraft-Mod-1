#name: Battlecruiser: Warp Drive
The Battlecruiser’s propulsion system allows it to slip into warp space, achieving faster than light travel. Drive failures have catastrophic consequences, such as total loss of ship and crew due to violent implosions. Besides the standard set of safety features, some Battlecruisers have a secondary, short range Warp Drive to reduce wear and tear on the main one. It also serves as backup in emergency situations—like the need to effect a blind jump, which is a very risky endeavor, to retreat from a hot zone. The shorter range reduces the likelihood that vessel and crew will end up stranded for years in a remote location.
