#name: Mutalisk: Wings
These leathery appendages afford the Mutalisk an astonishing degree of speed and maneuverability during atmospheric flight. Wing motion also generates energy that serves as a catalyst for the creature’s internal biological functions. They never stop flapping their wings, even when flying in a vacuum. We have determined that this is purely instinctual and unrelated to locomotion.
