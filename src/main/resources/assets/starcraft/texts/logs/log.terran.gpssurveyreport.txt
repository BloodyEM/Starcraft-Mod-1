"The surface of Char can reach such extreme temperatures that mineral deposits become molten and form rivers of crystal that flow across the planet's surface. A recent application of space geodetic techniques to this phenomenon has measured the amount and spatial pattern of net vertical crustal deformation and shows that these rivers sometimes snake across the planetary mantle in this liquid state for months before finally hardening. Mineral laden pathways are then created and can be seen protruding from the obsidian landscape, serving as both landmarks and rich mining fields."
