#name: Disruptor: Overview
The Disruptor was created under the Purifier program, which, through technological advancements in robotics and artificial intelligence, sought to replicate consciousness as data, preserving the thought processes and decision-making capabilities of formerly living beings. Originally, this construct was designed to channel the power of its Solarite Reactor through its alloy hull—rendering it invulnerable until the accumulated energy reached critical mass and unleashed a violent explosion. The stress to the Disruptor’s systems and structure proved too much to handle, but further refinements harnessed the destructive capabilities of the Solarite Reactor, allowing the Disruptor to perform its primary function: annihilate its intended targets with directed spheres of unstable energy.
