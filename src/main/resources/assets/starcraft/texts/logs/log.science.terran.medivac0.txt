#name: Medivac: Overview
Post-Brood War military analysis determined that 37% of Dominion troops serving in the field sustained heavy injuries and were removed from the combat zone for medical attention. This was an alarming statistic with disastrous implications: soldiers were in medical bays instead of en route to the front lines. Under Emperor Mengsk’s personal order, the Dropship was redesigned with medical technology to serve dual streamlined purposes – transportation and triage – thereby keeping Dominion Marines in the field longer, regardless of injury. It did not take long for the Umojan Protectorate and the Kel-Morian Combine to adopt this innovation as well.
