#name: Immortal: Phase Disruptors
Immortals are equipped with dual Phase Disruptor cannons, upgraded versions of the original Dragoon weapon systems, which fire powerful antimatter bolts sheathed in pure energy. These blasts can easily punch large holes in heavy plating, but their limited field of fire prevents Immortals from engaging aerial targets.
