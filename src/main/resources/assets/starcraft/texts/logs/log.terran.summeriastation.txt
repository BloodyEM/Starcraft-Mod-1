#name: Summeria Station
The Summeria V station -- heralded as our final, finest hope for peace -- was fraught with problems from the day it opened. From Elder races struggling for political dominance to the drama and personal feuds among the members of the command staff, each week brought new challenges. Finally, the hand of destiny played the unkindest card of all as a small black hole tore through the very center of the vast complex. While some speculate that this fissure was created when a concealed Xel’Naga artifact went awry, others claim that the black hole had been there all along and was merely shifted into our time continuum during unauthorized weapon testing. In any case, the station inhabitants are left to battle both the gravity well of the black hole and the hostile aliens that are stranded at Summeria V until the massive station finally collapses under its own weight.
