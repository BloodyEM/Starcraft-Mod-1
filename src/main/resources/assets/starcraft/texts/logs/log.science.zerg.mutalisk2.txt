#name: Mutalisk: Collapsible Structure
The rigors of deep space travel are a natural part of the Mutalisk’s life. The skin of their annelid-like bodies takes on a gelatinous consistency and seeps through the dermal layer. This process compacts their organs and circulatory system to prevent damage from external pressure.
