#name: Adept: Overview
Adepts are highly-trained battlefield commanders, originally intended by Hierarch Artanis to replace former Judicator caste leaders with Templar. These powerful warriors specialize in dealing with lightly-armored threats. Their Glaive Cannons fire discs of psionic energy, which, despite of their lower rate of fire, can punch veritable holes through enemy targets. In addition, Adepts can project a shade of themselves, and teleport to its location after a brief period of time—very useful for scouting enemy positions, or circumventing defensive emplacements.
