#name: Medivac: Capacity
The Medivac is larger and heavier than its predecessor, the Quantradyne Apod-33 Dropship, due to the medical bay and triage station in the rear of the ship, as well as the array of stabilizers and gyroscopes housed in the airframe that maintain the vessel’s level and orientation. This ship is also designed to ferry personnel and vehicles, including the massive Thor, to and from combat zones with minimal fuss, but its astronomical deployment costs—which amount to the weekly expenditures of a small colony town—are the reason the Dominion still trains and fields medics.
