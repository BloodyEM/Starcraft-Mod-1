Multiple twin-cannon laser batteries for aerial defense and surface bombardment bristle on the hull of the Battlecruiser. Its air-to-air guns—not as powerful as its air-to-ground ones—are equipped with advanced optics and sensors to deal with fast moving targets. The vessel’s air-to-ground guns make use of electromagnetic coils to increase the potency of their shots. During an engagement with a pirate flagship, the crew of a badly damaged Minotaur-Class Battlecruiser performed a daring roll maneuver to bring the ship’s air-to-ground batteries to bear. The barrage staved off the enemy until the cruiser´s warp drive engaged, allowing it to escape.
