#name: Thor: Cockpit
The cockpit of the Thor is pressurized and protected by a military-grade Steelglass canopy, as well as thick layers of composite neosteel-ceramic armor. At its center lies the pilot´s seat, which helps prevent operator injuries through powerful inertial dampeners and a foam-padded six-point harness. Multiple gauges and screens monitor the mech’s systems, and the main holographic display projects computer-generated imagery of the terrain. Were this screen to fail, the Steelglass canopy has a fully integrated heads-up-display, a navigation screen, and a basic targeting system even if Thor pilots don’t really need to aim.
