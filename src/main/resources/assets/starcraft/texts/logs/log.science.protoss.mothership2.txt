The Mothership’s khaydarin crystal core radiates a considerable amount of quickly-dissipating energy. Once the Mothership becomes fully operational, this dissipating power is absorbed by the wings and projected as a cloaking field that covers a wide area around the vessel. The Mothership itself does not benefit from said field, but it renders nearby Protoss forces, structures, and allies invisible to the naked eye.
