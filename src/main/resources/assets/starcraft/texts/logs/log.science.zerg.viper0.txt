Carrying on in the support role once held by the Zerg Defiler, the Viper combines several vicious biological weapons to weaken enemy forces and give an edge to the Swarm.  This winged menace stores a thick microbial soup within its abdomen, and can spray the viscous mixture into the air whenever ranged foes approach – essentially nullifying the effectiveness of their armaments until they can move out of the cloying mist.  Enemies hoping to escape to high ground are quickly snatched from their dominant position by the Viper’s muscular proboscis, allowing the zerg to counter just about any tactical terrain advantage.  When fatigued, the Viper can siphon bioelectrical energy and nutrients from other Zerg buildings, allowing it to quickly return to the fray and cause further mayhem.
