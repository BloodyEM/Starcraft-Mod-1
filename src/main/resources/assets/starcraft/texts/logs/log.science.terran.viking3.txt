Vikings boast twin gatling cannons for ground combat, and a large payload of Lanzer Torpedoes to engage aerial targets. The armor-piercing warheads are particularly effective against capital ships, but their impact on lighter vessels is diminished. To solve the issue, Enlightened Dynamics developed Ripwave Missiles, specialized ordnance that releases deadly bursts of sub-atomic shrapnel. This upgrade, combined with the Phobos-class weapons system by Bellerephon, turns the craft into a force to be reckoned with. Nonetheless, due to hefty implementation costs, only a handful of Vikings have been retrofitted as such.
