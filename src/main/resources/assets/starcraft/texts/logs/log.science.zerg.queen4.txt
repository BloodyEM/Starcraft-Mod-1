#name: Queen: Brain Mass
Encased in an armored skull, and connected to a set of nerve cords that bear some resemblance to the protoss’, the Queen’s brain is an advanced biological structure with great mental capabilities. Granted the ability of limited independent thought and analysis—and the possibility to evolve and grow through experience—the new Queens can easily coordinate lesser Zerg creatures, as well as analyze and relay any tactical data fed to them by the Overlords.
