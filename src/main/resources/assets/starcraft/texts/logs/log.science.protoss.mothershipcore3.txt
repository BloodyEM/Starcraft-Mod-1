#name: Mothership Core: Time Warp
The Mothership Core can bend space-time to create a field where the present dilates and stretches endlessly. The unpredictable energy flux within this field bears down heavily on anything that crosses it. Enemy forces caught in the Time Warp are slowed to a crawl, allowing the Firstborn to dispatch them with ease.
