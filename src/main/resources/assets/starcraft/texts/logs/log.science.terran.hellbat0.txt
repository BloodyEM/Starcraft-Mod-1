#name: Hellbat: Overview
The original Hellion has proved its effectiveness in recent years and throughout numerous combat campaigns. No surprise then that the Dominion has opted to provide an upgrade to this versatile off road vehicle. Designs for the Hellbat make use of its predecessor’s base platform but add a complex, state of the art new feature set: robotics. The most striking advancement comes in “battle mode,” which reconfigures the buggy into a mechanized walker.
