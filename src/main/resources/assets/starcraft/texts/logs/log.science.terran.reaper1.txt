#name: Reaper: P-12 Gauss Pistol
The “Scythe” can be chambered with two types of ammunition: hollow point rounds for close quarters, or the infamous U-238 “hot shots” for longer range and penetration. Older variants used supercharged coils  to achieve higher muzzle velocities, resulting in grievous wounds to unarmored targets at the expense of fast barrel degradation and weapon malfunctions. To address these costly issues, the P-45 coils have been redesigned, taking away some of the gun’s bite. Nonetheless, few stand bravely on the business end of the Grim Reaper's Scythes.
