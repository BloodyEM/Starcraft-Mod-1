Born with incredible psionic potential, these individuals are recruited, quarantined, and put into training by the government from childhood. Ghosts learn to channel their psionic energies to augment their natural physical strength and endurance. They are rightly feared for their preternatural sniping ability with the C-10 Canister Rifle and their advanced stealth maneuvering. Ghosts can be equipped with psionically powered Personal Cloaking devices that allow them to become virtually undetectable by enemies without specialized sensory equipment.
