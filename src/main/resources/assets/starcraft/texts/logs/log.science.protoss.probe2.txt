#name: Probe: Outer Shell
An example of Khalai technological achievement, Probes are functional, light, and easy to produce. Their outer shell does not offer much in the way of protection—even factoring in their plasma shield—but it allows Probes to operate virtually anywhere without sacrificing speed or mobility. The frame can also absorb light and turn it into energy, forgoing the need for a power supply.
