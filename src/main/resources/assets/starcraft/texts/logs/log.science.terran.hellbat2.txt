After a friendly fire incident that killed 17 marines and sent 48 to the medbay with fourth-degree burns, the Hellbat’s antiquated targeting system—a relic even by the original Hellion’s standards—was replaced with a more sophisticated version. The new system provides better target acquisition, tracking functionality, and enhances the Hellbat operator’s situational awareness. However, no targeting system can make up for the fact that the weapon sprays napalm. Troops are advised to steer clear of the line of fire.
