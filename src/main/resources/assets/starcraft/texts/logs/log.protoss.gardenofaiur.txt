#name: Garden Of Aiur
Since its creation at the end of the Aeon of Strife, a sacred garden has been a maintained as a center for peace, tranquility and reflection upon the ways of the Khala. Following the destruction of Aiur's defenders at the hands of the Zerg, the garden became a focal point for pitched conflicts between the ravenous Swarm, mercenary Terrans in search of salvage, and the few remaining Protoss forces.
