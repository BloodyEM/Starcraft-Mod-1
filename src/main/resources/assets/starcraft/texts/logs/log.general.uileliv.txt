The universe is home to some rather odd geological formations that create a rich tapestry for astrologers, whether professional or amateur. On 20th Century Earth, for example, people could swear that there was a face on the surface of Mars. The location of the rocks and the eerie placement of shadows made envisioned mouth and eyes seem all too real. A prominent mountain range on the planet of Uilel IV looks just like a snake winding its way across the surface of the planet. One of the strangest of these planetary anomalies is found on an island just off of the main continent on Mar Sara. Explorers who first saw the island mistook it for a gargantuan turtle -- initially a cause for great alarm. Closer inspection quickly revealed the true nature of the landmass, but to this day nearby residents still call the place "Turtle Island."
