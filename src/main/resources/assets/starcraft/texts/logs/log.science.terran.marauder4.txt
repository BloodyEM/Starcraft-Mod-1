The armored infantry suit, unlike its operator, can take a lot of punishment. Soldier fatalities were commonplace after particularly nasty impacts, even if the armor wasn’t breached. To prevent this, Wolfe Industries developed a cutting-edge shock dispersion weave that houses a soft gel core. When the armor takes a hit, the weave contracts and expands, redirecting impact force away from the operator. The increase in survivability has meant the difference between victory or defeat in multiple skirmishes throughout the Koprulu sector, easily justifying upgrade expenses.
