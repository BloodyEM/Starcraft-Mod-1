Originally, the Mantis Screamers were born with a stinger of considerable size on their tails, but, at an uncertain point in history, Glave parasites—natives of a “dead” planet in the Dinares sector—infested a rather large clutch of Screamer eggs. The Glaves consumed the embryos’ stingers and took their place, modifying the Screamer’s tail accordingly. After being assimilated by the Swarm, the Glave was slightly altered, and it now spawns and launches destructive, semi-sentient Wurms with great force.
