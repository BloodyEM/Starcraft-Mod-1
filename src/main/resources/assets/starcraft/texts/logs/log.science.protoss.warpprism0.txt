#name: Warp Prism: Overview
For thousands of years the Protoss have studied the nature of time and space, gaining insight into the universe’s greatest mysteries. Using psionic manufacturing processes, they created a robotic mind whose programming is built into the molecules of an advanced crystal lattice. The resulting device is able to manipulate matter and energy with incredible precision. Warp Prisms are used primarily to transport forces on the battlefield, but they can also be deployed into Phasing Mode so as to power nearby structures if necessary. When Warp Prisms are in this mode, they can temporarily replace destroyed Pylons or enable rapid expansion.
