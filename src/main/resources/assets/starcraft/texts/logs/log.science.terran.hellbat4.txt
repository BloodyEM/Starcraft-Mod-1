With the advent of the Hellbat, it became a necessity to replace the Hellion’s scant plating. Dominion engineers used an experimental paristeel / bonded carbide weave—lighter and better insulated—to protect operator and machine from the incredibly high temperatures of the Napalm Spray. Additional heat-shielding, made from an expanding and re-forming material, was installed under the Hellion’s chassis. It has proven very effective as a means of additional insulation, and it doubles as a solid riot shield.
