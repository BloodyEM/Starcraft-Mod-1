Recovered zerg sample continues to evolve. Clearly has motor function despite the lack of anything like a neural cortex. It's giving off more heat than it could possibly be absorbing in that tank.

I'm learning how some zerg burrow as well. It's extremely sophisticated. They have billions of tiny muscles that vibrate at a low frequency, effectively loosening soil, crumbling rock, and snapping vegetation. They can "swim" through the ground. It's not quite as fast as running, but it's close.

I can see a way to put this knowledge to good use.
