#name: Colossus: Targeting System
The Colossus’ Targeting System uses a robotic AI—along with gravity-sensitive gyroscopes—to analyze target composition, and predict their movement patterns. This ensures the Thermal Lance’s beams will sear a path of maximum destruction among enemy forces. The Targeting System is so precise that the Colossus can fire its weapons point blank without risk of damaging itself.
