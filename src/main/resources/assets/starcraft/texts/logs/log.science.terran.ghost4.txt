#name: Ghost: Neural Inhibitors
Individuals with psionic abilities are dangerous, posing a very real threat to themselves and to the sector at large; especially after being trained as Ghost agents. To prevent unnecessary loss of life—and to exert control over their assets—the Dominion, following the footsteps of the Confederacy, uses a specialized type of cybernetic implant to keep the aggression levels and behavioral patterns of their Ghosts in check. Still, as a few hapless commanders have learned, these implants are not exempt from malfunction—or surgical removal.
