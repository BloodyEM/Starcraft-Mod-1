#name: Invasion Of Aiur
"The Zerg invasion of Aiur brought untold death and devastation to the planet, but in many ways the darkest days in the history of the Protoss were shortly before the departure of the Dark Templar, when the barely reunited tribes began to fight once more. Old vendettas and ancient prejudices were reborn as the Protoss who refused the way of Khala were branded as traitors and hunted down. Grand battles scarred the surface and many bold warriors were slain in massive engagements."
