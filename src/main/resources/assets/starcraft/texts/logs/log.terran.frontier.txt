The Terran frontier has remained a place devoid of any semblance of law and order for decades. On the desolate strips of prefabricated roadway that stretch between border colonies, gangs and outcast aliens terrorize any wayward travelers foolish enough to encroach into their territory. Traders and treasure seekers use these dangerous byways at their own risk. When two or more gangs square off in arguments over salvage rights or in border disputes, these highways host battles unrivaled in their ferocity and violence.
