For more than a thousand years, the Protoss of the Templar caste have defended their people, dedicating their long lives to the pursuit of martial perfection. Zealots are peerless warriors who have yet to ascend to the uppermost ranks of the Khala. Ever eager for advancement, they train for decades in hand-to-hand combat, tactics, pain tolerance, and martial discipline. Their formidable physiques are further enhanced by cybernetic implants and power suits. Zealots use their substantial psionic abilities to create blades of pure energy that serve as their primary melee weapons.
