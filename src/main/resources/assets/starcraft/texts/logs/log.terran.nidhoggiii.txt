When the miners of the tiny "Edgar & Sons" mining company landed on Nidhogg III, it was if they had stepped into a dream. Vespene geysers covered the landscape like anthills, and hundreds -- if not thousands -- of mineral fields were scattered across the face of the planet where they had staked their latest claim. The deposits of Ore were so rich and plentiful that huge chunks could easily be broken off in their bare hands. Their dreams of limitless wealth came crashing to a halt, however, when one of the miners let slip the location of the site between rounds of Tyrador Mindbenders at a local spaceport bar. It wasn't long before the larger mining interests in the Sector descended like locusts. In an ironic twist of fate, little (if any) of the abundant wealth of Nidhogg III has ever been removed the planet, as its resources now fuel a never-ending war over who will control this paradise lost.
