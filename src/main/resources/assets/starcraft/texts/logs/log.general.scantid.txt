#name: Scantids
The original strain of Scantid grew to a length no greater than 15 Centimeters and was a common inhabitant of the desert regions of Korhal. The insect's mild venom, used to repel predatory animals, caused nothing more than mild rash and bothersome itching to those inadvertently stung by the shy animals. After Korhal was ravaged by nuclear fire in the surprise attack by the Confederates, nothing was left alive on the surface of the planet. Although the lowly Scantid survived in their deep underground communal burrows, exposure to massive radiation forever changed the creatures. Where once they had been nothing more than a footnote in Entomology journals, the Scantid were now monstrous beasts with claws capable of ripping a man in half and a stinger filled with an extremely lethal poison. If it were not for their lack of innate aggressiveness and the instinctive reflex to flee when threatened or injured, the Scantid may have over-run the planet, rendering Korhal virtually uninhabitable. Their communal instinct has also survived, and the area known as Scorpion Ravine is home to a large nest of the creatures. Although it seems dangerous, remember that the Scantid is more afraid of you than you are of it
