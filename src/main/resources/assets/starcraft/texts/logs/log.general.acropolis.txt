Recent explorations have uncovered a previously uncharted island on the jungle planet of Ynoth. Located at the center of this island are six massive citadels surrounding the ruins of a seventh. This has caused a stir amongst the Shelak tribe as the Protoss seer Khyar wrote several cryptic passages concerning an mystic Acropolis referred to "The Six and The One". While it written in his works that, "...the ruler of the Six shall use the One to become the Only..." Khyar was also called the Mad Prophet in more than one historical record. Whether this power is real or merely legend, there is a great deal of interest in controlling this island as well as the ancient citadels.
