#name: Tempest: Cockpit
Tempest pilots sit in a specially shielded cockpit overlooking the vessel’s primary weapon, where they make adjustments to ensure each blast is cohesive enough to reach the target. They also regulate the energy flow from the kinetic matrix to prevent catastrophic overloads which could compromise or destroy their ship. The power coursing through the Tempest’s hull is so monumental that its pilots must wear bulky dampening armor to withstand it.
