The SCV is a bipedal walker equipped with heavy-duty thrusters that allow it to hover. These thrusters were added after SCV prototypes proved unable to keep up with projected efficiency rates. Due to last minute integration, the thrusters were barely optimized for day-to-day operation, and are prone to overloading whenever they are set to high burn. The T-280’s manufacturer began work on new, more energy-efficient thrusters, but discarded the project upon learning that SCV races were popular in certain parts of the sector. As one would expect, this has not deterred the pilots from making “personal” adjustments.
