#name: High Templar: Vestments
The cloth-adorned armor worn by the High Templar is fashioned out of a light metal alloy that reacts to psionic input and, like the Zealot’s power suit, can be fitted with wrist-mounted projectors capable of shaping the user’s energy into psionic blades. However, as the High Templar forgo melee combat in the pursuit of psionic mastery, these weapons are considered a last resort.
