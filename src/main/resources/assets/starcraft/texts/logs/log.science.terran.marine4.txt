The upper back section of the CMC armor houses a series of tubes which make up the bulk of an efficient liquid cooling system, assisted by a twin set of high-speed turbines. These “afterburners”, as they are commonly known, vent the heat generated by the suit’s power supply, and the temperature buildup in harsh atmospheric conditions. Cold fusion reactors in the field have an operational failure rate below .05%—a proportion so impressive that it’s regularly attributed to divine providence.
