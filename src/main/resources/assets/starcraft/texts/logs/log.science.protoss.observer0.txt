#name: Observer: Overview
These small drones are employed to survey vast wasteland areas or record battles for the Protoss archives. Their complex sensor array can detect cloaked enemies with ease, making the Observer an invaluable auxiliary unit on the battlefield. However, the sensor array also depletes the Observer’s overall energy, which weakens the unit’s defensive capabilities. To compensate for their lack of armor power, Observers are equipped with a micro-cloaking field to hide them from the enemy. The drone’s small sensor signature allows it to maintain this field over long periods with very little drain on its power core.
